# ![Logo](https://github.com/ukdtom/WebTools.bundle/blob/master/Wiki/WebTools/Logos/WebTools-48x48.png) Known Issues

On this page, you can find a list of known issues with the latest version of WebTools

## Logs
* Note that some 3rd Party plug-ins use their own log routines, like Sub-Zero, and because of that, the highlighting of lines, where an error occurred, might fail when viewing those logs. We have no way of fixing this

## Subs
* If running Mac OSX, then deletion of subtitles has sadly been disabled in WebTools V3.0.0, due to code not yet finalized for that platform. [#420](https://github.com/ukdtom/WebTools.bundle/issues/420)
* Filter is sadly not working for Shows in V3.0.0 [#455](https://github.com/ukdtom/WebTools.bundle/issues/455)

## UI
* In V3.0.0, the UI is sadly not optimal when using a mobile device
 
## Shield
Since neither of the developers owns a Shield, and it seems like it behaves differently than other platforms, we sadly cannot support that platform.

## Playlists
Downloading playlists for non-owner sadly fails
