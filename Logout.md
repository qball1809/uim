You may ask why a Logout button is needed. If you are accessing WebTools on a publicly available workstation or you simply want to keep prying eyes from messing with your server, then WebTools provides this invaluable option.

When you click on logout, WebTools will do just that, log you out, clear the cookie from your browser's cache, and the next time you access WebTools you will be required to log in again and thereby keep your server from those prying eyes and keep your server and settings from being tampered with.

Just remember, in order to keep your server and WebTools secure, either logout, or close your web browser.
