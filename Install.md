### Manual Installation
If you want/need to install WebTools manually, follow these steps:

* [Download WebTools here](https://github.com/dagalufh/WebTools.bundle/releases/latest) 
* Extract all files from the zip file
* Copy the extracted files to the [Plug-ins directory](https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/201106098)
* Make sure the directory is named WebTools.bundle (and **NOT** WebTools.bundle-master)
* Make sure the WebTools.bundle directory contains a directory named "Contents". If not, then you might be one directory too high!
* If running Linux or Mac OS X, also make sure that the user running Plex Media Server has the correct permissions to the WebTools.bundle directory and it's contents.

Your Plug-ins folder should look something like this after manually installing WebTools.
