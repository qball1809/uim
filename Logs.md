The search tool bar comprises the following functions (from left to right):

1. The Search text box. Enter the term you wish to search for in this text box.
2. The Search button. Clicking on this button will initiate the search.
3. The Clear Search button. This will clear your search term from the search text box.
4. The Previous button. This will search for the previous line that contains your search term.
5. The Next button. This will search for the next line that contains your search term.
6. The Jump To Top button. This will return you to the top of the page from any location.

## The Log File Selector

Use the log file selector drop down menu to select the log file you wish to view. When viewing large files it is often better to download the log file to a location on your computer and then open it using a text editor.

## The Download Buttons

Clicking on the 'Download the selected log file' button will download the currently selected log file to a location on your computer.

Clicking on the 'Download all log files in a ZIP file' will download all of the available Plex log files in a .zip archive, to a location on your computer.

This is very handy when you need help with diagnosing an issue with your Plex Media Server in the Plex forums, and compared to the [built-in log download function in PMS](https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/200250417-Plex-Media-Server-Log-Files), this one not only preserves the file structure and file dates, but also includes logs from 3rd Party plugins, such as WebTools.
