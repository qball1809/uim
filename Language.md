Clicking on the Language menu button will present you with the following screen:

![](https://github.com/ukdtom/WebTools.bundle/blob/master/Wiki/WebTools/Language/L-image01.png)

Here you can change the language that WebTools uses to display the text with. You will notice the drop down menu where you may select your desired language and you may also notice that beside any given language there is a percentage shown in brackets (99%).

The percentage indicates how many text strings have been converted to that language.

If the percentage for your language is not 100%, it means that we have not yet translated all the strings to your language, and as such we could use your help [here](https://poeditor.com/join/project/8uRxEmAE4M).

Clicking on the 'Force Language Translation Update` button will update your language with what's current on the translation site.

All text strings start out as English, but by clicking on the [POEditor](https://poeditor.com/join/project/8uRxEmAE4M) link, you can join up to help correct the text strings for your language and change those English text strings to text strings in your language.

Important Note:

If you decided to sign up to help translate WebTools, then please note the following:

Sadly, we have seen, that some people sign up, get added to the WebTools about page, but never translate anything :-1:

We find this unfair to all of the people that work hard to translate WebTools, so that other people can enjoy it in their language, and we feel it is necessary to take action, reluctantly ...

So this is the deal, when signing up ...

When you sign up to translate one or more languages for WebTools, we do expect that you translate at least one string.

So, 14 days after signing up, we will look at the work you have done, and if you have not contributed anything at all, or the amount of translations seems unfair to the other translators, you will be removed from the translation list and you will be blocked from signing up again.

We believe that this will make it fair for those who work hard at making WebTools a great tool for everyone.

We hope everyone enjoys WebTools and we would like to thank all of those people who have contributed to making WebTools a great tool.

Thank You!
