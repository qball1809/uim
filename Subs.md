## Selecting a Library

Choose a library and then click on that library and you will be presented with a list of files in that library. Each file listed will show whether or not it has any subtitles associated with it and their location. You may also select the'Hide media without subtitles' option to remove any files from the list that do not have any subtitles associated with them. 

Embedded subtitles are found within the video itself and WebTools is unable to edit or delete these subtitles.

Sidecar subtitles are found alongside your video files, usually within the same folder. These files, along with subtitle files downloaded by one of the Plex agents may be deleted if required.

Burned In subtitles cannot be shown. If you wish to delete burned in subtitles you will need to replace the video file as burned in subtitles cannot be deleted or removed.

In the image below you will note five icons that appear when a subtitle is present, they are indicated by the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in RED text.

Clicking on one of these icons will do the following:
1. Check mark this box in order to delete the selected subtitle.
2. The Upload icon will allow you to upload your own subtitle file into your Plex library.
3. Clicking on the Trash can icon will delete only selected subtitles.
4. Clicking on this button will Download the subtitle to your computer.
5. Clicking on this button will allow you to view the contents of the subtitle file. Works for text based subtitles      only.

Note: Icon 1 will appear inline with any subtitle that is able to be deleted. Subtitles that cannot be deleted will not show this check box.
