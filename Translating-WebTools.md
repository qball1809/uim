# ![Logo](https://github.com/ukdtom/WebTools.bundle/blob/master/Wiki/WebTools/Logos/WebTools-48x48.png) Translating WebTools

If you decided to sign up to help translate WebTools, then please note the following:

Sadly, we have seen, that some people sign up, get added to the WebTools about page, but never translate anything :-1: 

We find this unfair to all of the people that work hard to translate WebTools, so that other people can enjoy it in their language, and we feel it is necessary to take action, reluctantly ...

So this is the deal, when signing up ...

When you sign up to translate one or more languages for WebTools, we do expect that you translate a fair amount of strings.

So, 14 days after signing up, we will look at the work you have done, and if you have not contributed anything at all, or the amount of translations seems unfair to the other translators, you will be removed from the translation list and you will be blocked from signing up again.

We believe that this will make it fair for those who work hard at making WebTools a great tool for everyone.

We hope everyone enjoys WebTools and we would like to thank all of those people who have contributed to making WebTools a great tool.

Thank You!
