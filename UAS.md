## About the UAS
The Unsupported Appstore (UAS) is a module running under the WebTools bundle, and is meant to ease the process of finding, downloading, installing, updating and (if need be) uninstalling **Unsupported** Plex plug-ins.

Please note that the plug-ins available here-in are not supported by the Plex Media Server "Plex Online" store for many reasons.

They may be unstable, unfinished, or provide access to content which may be offensive.

If you are having trouble with any of the plug-ins available through this app, please go to the respective plug-in's support thread.

You will find links to support pages or to the GitHub Repo by clicking on the down arrow which is located on the lower right of each of the listed apps within the UAS module.

The authors of WebTools take no responsibility for the content/stability/suitability of the plug-ins contained within the UAS and any complaints or requests for support in relation to specific plug-ins will be ignored.

## UAS
Entering the UAS (Unsupported App Store) you will be presented with a similar view to that shown below:

## Manual Installation

![](https://github.com/ukdtom/WebTools.bundle/blob/master/Wiki/WebTools/UAS/UAS-image08.png)

The manual installation text box allows you to quickly add a plug-in that has not already been included within the UAS. A typical url might look like this:

https://github.com/ukdtom/ExportTools.bundle

Simply enter that address into the Manual Installation text box and then click on the Manual Install button. UAS will then import the plug-in into your Plex Media Server and make it available under the unknown category in the UAS.

## The Buttons

The three buttons shown above have the following functions:

1. Migrate. This button allows you to import plug-ins that you have installed prior to installing WebTools and plug-ins that are not included in the Unsupported App Store.
2. Force UAS Update. This will force the UAS Repo to be re-downloaded from GitHub. Note: This may take several minutes to complete and during that time the UAS page may not be displayed.
3. Check for plug-in updates. This will check all of your installed plug-ins for updates.

## The Plug-ins

![](https://github.com/ukdtom/WebTools.bundle/blob/master/Wiki/WebTools/UAS/UAS-image07.png)

Each plug-in is displayed in it's own window. This window gives you the name of the plug-in and a brief description of what that plug-in is capable of.

You will also notice an `Install` button if this plug-in is not currently installed. Clicking on the `Install` button will install the plug-in into your Plex Media Server.

If the plug-in is already installed, then it will display an `Update` button in place of the `Install` button and you will also see a `Delete` button that allows you to delete the plug-in from your Plex Media Server.

The `Down Arrow` button will expand the plug-in window and display additional information, including the repository address, related to that plug-in.

If the plug-in window is expanded, the `Down Arrow` button will change to an `Up Arrow` button which will close or un-expand the plug-in window.

If you first click on the `Installed` category in the category selector (right of screen) then click on the `Down Arrow`, you will see additional information such as when the plug-in was last updated.

## The Search Tool Box

![](https://github.com/ukdtom/WebTools.bundle/blob/master/Wiki/WebTools/UAS/UAS-image03.png)

The search tool box contains the search text box where you are able to type in a search term. You may then click on the search button.

As you type your search term into the search text box, WebTools will automatically start retrieving results that match your search term. You may also press enter to complete your search term.

Below the Search text box you will see a list of categories that you are able to search in. If you are unable to find the plug-in you are looking for, then select another category and the plug-in may appear.

Clicking on a Category will also display all available plug-ins within that Category. You will also notice that the  the number of plug-ins you have installed in that category are displayed beside each category followed by the total number of plug-ins in that category.

You may also click on the Installed category. This category will display only those plug-ins that you have currently installed in Plex.

## Updating Plug-ins

**Note:** We only check for updates, when you manually press the "Check for updates" button

When updates for your plug-ins are available you will see a notice appear at the top of the category selector (as shown above).

![](https://github.com/ukdtom/WebTools.bundle/blob/master/Wiki/WebTools/UAS/UAS-image12.png)

You should then click on the 'Updates Available' notice to display all of your currently installed plug-ins that have an update available and then you may update each one of your plug-ins by clicking on the Update button for each plug-in or you may click on the Update All button (as shown above) to update all of the plug-ins in one go.

![](https://github.com/ukdtom/WebTools.bundle/blob/master/Wiki/WebTools/UAS/UAS-image11.png)

After clicking on the update button, a message wiill appear informing you of a successful update for your plug-in.

**Note:** The 'App successfully updated' message will continue to appear until you leave the UAS module. Upon entering the UAS module again, the message should no longer appear.
